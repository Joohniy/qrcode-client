# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Description Description of what was developed

Here we are dealing with the client, defining our screens from react-rout-dom v6, we render three components for this application:
The first component CreateUser, has the function of capturing and registering in our database the credentials typed in the inputs, using Axios, we send our POST request to be properly treated in our server-side nodejs, alternating between screens, using useNavigate and sending information by useLocation, we arrive at the second component.
Our second component tries to show us our QRCode, which will contain the link to our user's page, to create the QRCode, we use the react-qr-code library, passing our value in it, in this case the link to our third and final screen.
On our last screen, we render all the information that was registered in our first component, duly treated, we show the LinkedIn and GitHub links, which are rescued in our response coming from our server-side, capturing our user ID by the URL, we do the ID query and thus returning to our client all the credentials saved in the database, using an Axios GET to show our screen to the user.

Some unit tests were done, in our first component that tries to save our user's information.
